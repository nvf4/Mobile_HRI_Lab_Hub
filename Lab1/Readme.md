# Interaction First

In this lab, you will modify a robotic creature (ConeBot) that is originally designed by [Dr. Rei Lee](https://infosci.cornell.edu/~reilee/), a friend of our lab. The [ConeBot](https://infosci.cornell.edu/~reilee/ConeBot/) is a shy robot that hides under a small traffic cone. It is adventuring the world by itself but hopes people don't notice it at all.

Today, you will work with a close relative of ConeBot, CloneBot. Though closely related, CloneBot's personality (robotality?) is quite the opposite of ConeBot. It is outgoing and love to hangout with people. You will work with CloneBot and design its legendary adventure. 



## Prep
For this week's lab (and also the following week), you will work in groups of 3. Due to class size, one group might end up with two members, that's fine!

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Smart Phone (Laptop or Tablets also work) -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to connect to WiFi and display a webpage.
2. To work in a group of 3 (encouraged) or 4 people (if necessary).

\*\***List the names and NetID for your partners here.**\*\*

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 5 Storyboards
3. Any reflections you have on the process
4. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions (selected from the 5 storyboards)
5. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Build Your Clonebot](#part-a-build-your-clonebot)

B) [Plan](#part-b-plan) 

C) [Act out the interaction](#part-c-act-out-the-interaction) 


Labs are due on Tuesdays before class. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Build Your Clonebot
Follow the instructions [here](https://cornell.box.com/s/i0ykqbfz3y1fj195jax0s28v1n1vsx4o) to build your robot!
The instructions are arranged in stages. At the beginning of each stage, each group must select one (and only one) representitive to pick up parts from us. 

After you finish your robot, plug in power (plug in the USB to the battery pack). Following the instructions below to connect to your robot.
1. Connect to WiFi "MobileHRI-x", where x is the number assigned to the ESP-32. (ESP-32 should flesh once.)
2. Open a brower, in the address line, type in 192.168.4.1
3. You should be see a control interface. Try out different buttons and see what they do.

## Part B. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your CloneBot, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., an office, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? Reflect on the design of current day home mobile robots like Roomba. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., picking up a pen, opening the fridge). 

Leverage the possible motions of Clonebot and the extra degree of freedom provided by the motor on the top.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch five storyboards of the interactions you are planning. **It does not need to be perfect**, but must get across the behavior of the CloneBot and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*


## Part C. Act out the Interaction

Select 3 of the 5 storyboards to act out. Try physically acting out the 3 interactions you planned with your teammates. (Do not plug in the CloneBot just yet.) Record these video clips and submit them (Unlisted youtube links are fine).

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
